## 🎯 Overview

The AIOps Log Intelligence System is designed to solve real-world operational challenges:

- **Log Volume Crisis**: Analyze thousands of log entries automatically
- **Alert Fatigue**: Intelligent classification reduces noise with severity-based prioritization
- **Context Loss**: Rich structured alerts with remediation suggestions
- **Manual Effort**: Automated LLM-powered error analysis with intelligent fallbacks

Perfect for:
- DevOps teams managing microservices
- SRE platforms requiring intelligent monitoring
- Incident response automation
- Log aggregation pipelines (ELK, Splunk integration)

## ✨ Features

### Core Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Multi-Provider LLM** | Supports Claude (Anthropic) & GPT-4o (OpenAI) with auto-fallback |
| **Smart Classification** | 5-tier severity system: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFO |
| **Intelligent Fallback** | Rule-based pattern matching when LLM unavailable |
| **Structured Output** | Color-coded terminal tables + JSON export |
| **Log Parsing** | Flexible format: `timestamp \| level \| service \| message \| [error_code]` |
| **Error Remediation** | Context-aware fix suggestions for each alert |
| **Summary Statistics** | Severity breakdown and alert analytics |
| **Real-time Analysis** | Stream processing capability |

### Security & Performance

- ✅ No log data sent to 3rd parties (LLM classification only)
- ✅ Graceful API error handling with automatic fallback
- ✅ Efficient pattern matching with compiled regex
- ✅ Type hints throughout for IDE support
- ✅ Production-grade error handling
